# variable rules:
	# variable names can only contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. ex: name_1 
	# variable names can only start with letters and underscore, but nit with number. ex: message_1
	# spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscore can be used to seperate variable names: ex: first_name
	# avoid using python built-in functions such print as variable names
	# name should be short but descritptive. ex: name, student_name, name_length
	# kind in mind lower case l and o could be confuse for 1 and 0
